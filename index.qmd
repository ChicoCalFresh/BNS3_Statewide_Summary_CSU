## Overview 

- The [Center for Healthy Communities](https://chcchicostate.org/) (CHC) developed the **Basic Needs and Student Success Survey (BNS3)** and administered it to undergraduate students participating in the [Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)](https://www2.calstate.edu/attend/student-services/eop) or the Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) at 12 colleges across the CSU, CCC, and UC systems from 2022 to 2023.
- This site provides a top level descriptive analysis of each question in the survey for **CSU Campuses ONLY (n = `r nrow(bns)` students)**
  - [Click here](https://chicocalfresh.github.io/BNS3_Statewide_Summary/) to view the combined results for all 12 campuses.
  
## Purpose

The main purpose of this third cross-sectional study was to evaluate the following:

-   The impact of receiving [CalFresh Food Benefits](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/index.shtml)
-   Barriers to applying to CalFresh Food
-   College student food insecurity
-   The impact of and barriers to using other basic needs services

## Participants {#ref-md}

-   EOP/EOPS offices assisted in the recruitment by emailing interest form links to their EOP/EOPS students.
-   Students who met the eligibility criteria of being undergraduate EOP/EOPS students and receiving less than 11 meals per week from other services (used as an eligibility criterion when determining CalFresh Food eligibility) were then emailed a survey.
-   Participants were given a \$25 gift card incentive for completing the survey.
-   EOP/EOPS students were identified as the target population for this survey based on their low-income and first-generation student status, which indicates a higher probability of using CalFresh Food and being likely eligible for CalFresh Food.

A total of **`r nrow(bns)` EOP/EOPS students** were surveyed from the CSU campuses.

## Disclaimer on Missing Data

*Students had the option to select "Prefer not to answer" for all questions, or options such as "I don't know" for a small subset of questions, and these responses were set as missing values. In addition, `r get_count_and_percent(bns$finished, 'FALSE')` students did not finish the survey. These two factors are the cause of missing data (i.e., not 100% of respondents reporting). In each table/figure, the n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses.*
