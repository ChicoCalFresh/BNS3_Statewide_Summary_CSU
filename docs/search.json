The x-axis is the response option, and the y-axis is the frequency in which they occured.\nThe numbers above the bars represent the total respondents in the given group, as well as the percent of the data that they comprise.\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. 2: Figure Caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the barplot above, the histogram shows the distribution for a numeric variable of interest on the x-axis and the frequency in which they occured on the y-axis.\nThe mean of the variable of interest is denoted by a vertical dotted line.\n\n\n\n\nLikert Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. 3: Figure Caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Likert plot is a barplot visualization for a Likert scale, which is used to measure feelings/opinions for a specific question.\n\nThe center line (0%) divides the responses into two groups, such as above where the left side of the chart represents strongly disagree/disagree/neither agree nor disagree and the right hand side represents agree/strongly agree.\n\nThe percentages represent the proportion of the data for which the “group” composes.\n\nThe (n=#) next to the question denotes how many students responded to a specific question. The values can vary for each question within the same plot."

This may or may not include your roommate(s).\nBased on the household you defined in the previous question, how much is your household’s gross monthly income (before taxes and not including financial aid)? Note: Monthly income is money earned from jobs on your pay stubs, paid internships, or money deposited in your accounts every month from others (like parents). If you are not sure about your gross income, take your hourly rate and multiply by the number of hours you work per month. Please do NOT include financial aid or grants. Please do NOT include one-time monetary gifts from family or friends. Please do NOT include any balance in personal savings accounts. Remember, if you have a household of more than 1, you must include everyone’s gross income (use your best guess).\n\nAdditional Notes: Household size and income are used to determine CalFresh Food eligibility (among other factors). Cells highlighted in green indicate a student is likely eligible for CalFresh Food based on their self-reported income/household size, and cells highlighted in red indicate a student is likely ineligible. Household size was asked in a multiple choice format with options ranging from “1 (myself)” to “8 or more (myself plus 7, etc.),” where those who reported eight or more were coded as “8.” Hence, there was some uncertainty in determining eligibility among students who reported a household size of eight or more and a higher income, where these cells are highlighted in yellow.\nSummary: The most common household size reported was a household size of 1, while the most common income reported was $151-$2,148. A total of 60 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of less than $150, and 129 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of $151-$2,148 were deemed likely eligible for CalFresh Food. Of those with a household size of one, 80.4% met the income/household size eligibility criteria. Of those with a household size of two, 75.9% met the income/household size eligibility criteria."

CalFresh Food Eligibility (n=951, 77% of 1238 reporting).\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Questions: This variable was derived using self-reported household size and income (See Income & Household Size)\nAdditional Notes: Only county workers have the authority to determine official eligibility for CalFresh Food. These eligibility rates were estimated based on self-reported household size and income. Below is a list of eligibility criteria for students:\n\nMeets household size/income requirements from the California Department of Social Services.\nThe person is either a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\n\nIf the person is between the ages of 18 to 49, and is at least a part-time student (enrolled in six or more units), then this person is classified as a student by the California Department of Social Services and needs to meet the following additional criteria:\n\nDoes not get more than half of their meals from meal plans (less than 11 per week). (All students from this study met this criterion as this was one of the inclusion criteria to take the survey)\nMeets one of the possible work requirements such as working 20 or more hours per week or being enrolled in an approved Local Program that Increases Employability (LPIE). At the time of the start of this survey, all EOP/EOPS programs were considered an LIPE, however, campuses now need to apply and receive approval for their program to be considered an LPIE. When determining eligibility, all students were assumed to meet the work requirement since they were all EOP/EOPS students.\n\n\nSummary: A total of 736 (77.4%) students were likely eligible for CalFresh Food, while 215 (22.6%) were likely not eligible. Many students selected “Prefer not to answer” when reporting their income. CalFresh Food eligibility was unable to be determined among these students and among any students who answered “Prefer not to answer” to household size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2.

A total of 799 (83.8%) students met the income/household size requirements, and 488 (42.8%) students met the 20 hours/week work exemption. As a reminder, students don’t need to meet a work requirement if they are enrolled in an LPIE such as an approved EOP/EOPS.\n\n\nImpact:\nOnly students who reported currently using CalFresh Food or used it in the past as a college student saw the following set of questions. Students were asked to report how much EBT they received per month, how many people they fed with their EBT, whether they received enough money, how long their EBT lasts every month, and their perceived impact of CalFresh Food on academic and non-academic matters.\n\nCalFresh Food EBT\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3.

In general, as the number of people fed through EBT increases, the per person average decreases.

Meanwhile, 195 (66.1%) students agreed or strongly agreed that they purchased healthier foods; 246 (82.6%) agreed or strongly agreed that they cooked more frequently; and 146 (50.5%) agreed or strongly agreed that they did not worry about food running out each month because of CalFresh.\n\n\n\nCalFresh Food - Barriers\n\n\n\nTable 5.4.
