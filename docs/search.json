Note: Monthly income is money earned from jobs on your pay stubs, paid internships, or money deposited in your accounts every month from others (like parents). If you are not sure about your gross income, take your hourly rate and multiply by the number of hours you work per month. Please do NOT include financial aid or grants. Please do NOT include one-time monetary gifts from family or friends. Please do NOT include any balance in personal savings accounts. Remember, if you have a household of more than 1, you must include everyone’s gross income (use your best guess).\n\nAdditional Notes: Household size and income are used to determine CalFresh Food eligibility (among other factors). Cells highlighted in green indicate a student is likely eligible for CalFresh Food based on their self-reported income/household size, and cells highlighted in red indicate a student is likely ineligible. Household size was asked in a multiple choice format with options ranging from “1 (myself)” to “8 or more (myself plus 7, etc.),” where those who reported eight or more were coded as “8.” Hence, there was some uncertainty in determining eligibility among students who reported a household size of eight or more and a higher income, where these cells are highlighted in yellow.\nSummary: The most common household size reported was a household size of 1, while the most common income reported was $151-$2,148. A total of 112 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of less than $150, and 229 students who had a household size of one with a monthly household income of $151-$2,148 were deemed likely eligible for CalFresh Food. Of those with a household size of one, 83.2% met the income/household size eligibility criteria. Of those with a household size of two, 80.7% met the income/household size eligibility criteria."

At the time of the start of this survey, all EOP/EOPS programs were considered an LIPE, however, campuses now need to apply and receive approval for their program to be considered an LPIE. When determining eligibility, all students were assumed to meet the work requirement since they were all EOP/EOPS students.\n\n\nSummary: A total of 1341 (81.0%) students were likely eligible for CalFresh Food, while 315 (19.0%) were likely not eligible.

A total of 1429 (86.1%) students met the income/household size requirements, and 774 (40.1%) students met the 20 hours/week work exemption.

In addition, 108 (8.7%) students did not finish the survey. These two factors are the cause of missing data (i.e., not 100% of respondents reporting). In each table/figure, the n reporting refers to the total number of non-missing responses, while the percent reporting reflects the percent of non-missing responses."

Remember that household is determined by the number of people you purchase and prepare food with. This may or may not include your roommates. For the following statements, please state whether they were often true, sometimes true, or never true for you/your household in the last 30 days.\nAdditional Notes: A two-item version of the validated USDA 10-item food insecurity screening tool1 was used, which has been validated among low-income families2, and has accurately identified household food insecurity in a nationally representative sample3. Students who responded with “Sometimes true” or “Often true” to any of the questions were deemed food insecure. Students also had the option to select “I don’t know,” and these responses were set to missing values.\nSummary: In the last 30 days of taking the survey, 936 (55.5%) students reported they worried about food running out before getting money to buy more food. Meanwhile, 829 (48.5%) students reported that the food they bought did not last, and they did not have money to get more."
