<p>This page provides a brief description of characteristics of 836 students that were determined to be likely eligible for CalFresh but not currently using it at the time of the survey. See the <a href="./CalFresh.html#calfresh-food-eligibility">CalFresh Food Eligibility</a> page for eligibility criteria and related survey question text. All participating college students were either in the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at the UC or CSU systems or in the Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) in the CCC systems.</p>
<p>Of the 1341 students who were likely eligible for CalFresh, 1289 responded to a survey question inquiring about their knowledge/use of CalFresh benefits and 836 (64.9%) did not report currently using CalFresh as a college student. 55 of the 1341 students who were likely eligible for CalFresh either did not finish the survey or selected “Prefer not to answer” for this question.</p>

<p><strong>Survey Question:</strong> <em>What are the reasons you do not have CalFresh or have never used CalFresh? (Select all that apply)</em></p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Only students who reported that they <em>Never heard of CalFresh;</em> <em>Heard of it, but never used it;</em> or <em>Used it before attending college</em> saw this question (See <a href="./CalFresh.html#cal_status_reference">CalFresh Food Status section</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong> The most common reason for students who were likely eligible for CalFresh Food, but reported not using CalFresh Food was because they did not think they are eligible, where 242 (34.7%) students selected this option. Meanwhile 131 (18.8%) reported that they have no time to complete the application and 113 (16.2%) students reported that they felt other students need CalFresh Food more than they do.</p>
